# Getting started

Hi, ミサカです。 
In the right corner of the HUD wallpaper misaka deployed a dialog which includes a user manual. In the misaka's memory, users can just click "user manual" to get in and English version is available.
Misaka is thinking that how to let user knows that that is a dialog and able to click using their mouse.
Unfortunately misaka cannot let the wallpaper auto go to the manual page at the first time user install this wallpaper because wallpaper engine does not store cookies... If it auto goes, it always goes.
The last things that misaka must let you know is, this version of misaka HUD is final and legacy. Misaka is planning to work on the next generation of misaka wallpaper which may named as "Misaka Control Panel" that based on angular2. This may cost serval months because misaka 17535 is a university student and in a heavy load now.
Thanks for your mail.
Misaka
